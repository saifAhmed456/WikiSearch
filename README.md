# WikiSearch

DESCRIPTION

In order to make Wikipedia search easy for myself, I developed this app

This is a simple app which shows a search bar in the main screen. Upon entering any text in the search field, it fetches the results from Wikipedia api and displays the results in a table view. Tapping on any one of the rows will lead to another screen that loads the entire page.

If no results are found for the search it shows a no results image and a text requesting user to try with different search.

Displaying and hiding of results has been animated.


FRAMEWORKS 

RxSwift has been extensively used to develop the app. Moya framework has been used to make network calls.
